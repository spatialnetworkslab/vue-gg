`<vgg-section>`

# Description

The Section is one of the corner stones of `vue-gg`. Sections have many different
purposes, such as:

1. Defining a local coordinate system
2. Indicating the ranges to which coordinates can be mapped
3. Providing an entry point for new data
4. Creating compositions of shapes that can be mapped to data

All of these will be discussed below, under [Usage](#usage)
